CHANGELOG
=========

1.1.2 (2016-10-05)
------------------

* Searching for database metadata only occurs within the last 128KB
  (128 * 1024 bytes) of the file, speeding detection of corrupt
  datafiles. Reported by Eric Teubert. GitHub #42.

1.1.1 (2016-09-15)
------------------

* Development files were added to the `.gitattributes` as `export-ignore` so
  that they are not part of the Composer release. Pull request by Michele
  Locati. GitHub #39.

1.1.0 (2016-01-04)
------------------

* The MaxMind DB extension now supports PHP 7. Pull request by John Boehr.
  GitHub #27.

1.0.3 (2015-03-13)
------------------

* All uses of `strlen` were removed. This should prevent issues in situations
  where the function is overloaded or otherwise broken.

1.0.2 (2015-01-19)
------------------

* Previously the MaxMind DB extension would cause a segfault if the Reader
  object's destructor was called without first having called the constructor.
  (Reported by Matthias Saou & Juan Peri. GitHub #20.)

1.0.1 (2015-01-12)
------------------

* In the last several releases, the version number in the extension was
  incorrect. This release is being done to correct it. No other code changes
  are included.

1.0.0 (2014-09-22)
------------------

* First production release.
* In the pure PHP reader, a string length test after `fread()` was replaced
  with the difference between the start pointer and the end pointer. This
  provided a 15% speed increase.

0.3.3 (2014-09-15)
------------------

* Clarified behavior of 128-bit type in documentation.
* Updated phpunit and fixed some test breakage from the newer version.

0.3.2 (2014-09-10)
------------------

* Fixed invalid reference to global class RuntimeException from namespaced
  code. Fixed by Steven Don. GitHub issue #15.
* Additional documentation of `Metadata` class as well as misc. documentation
  cleanup.

0.3.1 (2014-05-01)
------------------

* The API now works when `mbstring.func_overload` is set.
* BCMath is no longer required. If the decoder encounters a big integer,
  it will try to use GMP and then BCMath. If both of those fail, it will
  throw an exception. No databases released by MaxMind currently use big
  integers.
* The API now officially supports HHVM when using the pure PHP reader.

0.3.0 (2014-02-19)
------------------

* This API is now licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0.
* The code for the C extension was cleaned up, fixing several potential
  issues.

0.2.0 (2013-10-21)
------------------

* Added optional C extension for using libmaxminddb in place of the pure PHP
  reader.
* Significantly improved error handling in pure PHP reader.
* Improved performance for IPv4 lookups in an IPv6 database.

0.1.0 (2013-07-16)
------------------

* Initial release
